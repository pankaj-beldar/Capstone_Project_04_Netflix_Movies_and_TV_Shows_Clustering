# **Clustering with Word2vec**

1. K-Means with 0.6092 silhouette_score with word2vec has optimum number of clusters as 6

2. K-Means with Elbow method with word2vec has 5 optimum clusters.

3. Agglomerative Clustering with dendogram with word2vec has 5 optimum clusters

4. Agglomerative Clustering with 0.53 silhouette_score with word2vec gives 4 clusters

5. Affinity propagation clustering with woed2vec has 5 optimum clusters

# **Clstering with CountVectorizer**

1. It is observed that , after using CountVectorizer and tfidfVectorizer, we get the less silhouette_score as 0.032

2. Hence we can say word2vec word embending method is more suitable for our model.
